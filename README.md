# SQL Mini Projects 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **30 SQL mini projects**, each designed to help you master different SQL concepts step by step.  
Every project includes:
- Database schema (`tables.sql`)
- Sample data (`data.sql`)
- Practice queries (`queries.sql`)
- A `README.md` explaining the project

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open **MySQL Workbench** (or your preferred SQL client).  
2. Create a new database for each project.  
3. Run `tables.sql` to set up schema.  
4. Run `data.sql` to load sample data.  
5. Try out `queries.sql` for practice.
